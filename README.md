## Portfolio

Hello. My name is Matthew Weston and this is my personal portfolio. I've been learning 
coding and programming for about two years now and here's a demo of some of what I've 
been able to make.

If you'd like to demo some of my work, you can go to the portfolio page and sample some 
of the links. You can also check my repositories on https://github.com/mweston6288.

##Current portfolio projects:

# Random password Generator:
* Create a password consisting of capital and lowercase letters, numbers, and special 
characters.

# Coding Quiz
* A short quiz on coding. Aim to get the high score by quickly and correctly answering 
the questions.

# Day Scheduler
* A notebook to plan out the day. It tracks the time of day so you can't schedule 
something in the past

And there is more to come.

If you'd like to contact me, I can be reached via email at:
